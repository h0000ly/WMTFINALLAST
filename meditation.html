                    The meditation that is applied in our gym is called "mindfullness". Thanks to the process of metacognition (the capacity for self-observation 
                    and awareness of one's cognitive processes) stimulated by insight, that is to get in touch with our sensations, emotions and thoughts, without 
                    chasing away anything, not even suffering, to learn that even thoughts are impermanent, they are not "facts", and that in the same way they 
                    arrived, they will soon go away, so it is important not to identify with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practicing meditation daily brings about changes in our brain through neuroplasticity, the ability of our brain to modify its own structure and functions 
                    based on the stimuli it receives, both internal and external.<br>
                    And it is this ability that will help to increase new neural connections that will lead to a transformative process capable of interrupting the automatisms. 
                    Without seeking results, without setting self-improvement as the only goal, learning to let go, with patience and trust, accepting everything we are and think, 
                    without judging, in the sense of not labeling everything to try to calm the mind by avoiding it. restlessness that comes from doubt.

                    Consequently, a clearer and calmer mind will help decrease stress, and therefore also our blood glucocorticoid levels, the steroid hormone released 
                    by the adrenal gland, which includes cortisol, cortisone and corticosterone, which often contribute to worsening of numerous diseases and an increase 
                    in physical and mental discomfort.
